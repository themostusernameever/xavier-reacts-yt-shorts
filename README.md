# xavier-reacts-yt-shorts
this is (going to be) a script, that allows you to make those weird yt shorts
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/shorts/-TN_uQVQaX8">like here</a>

(note that i haven't even started to make this project, "i just claimed the position" lmao)

**CURRENT PLAN**
*make this script just make videos
*search thru reddit to find memes
*(possibly) add an ai that will automaticly make this deepfake? not sure about that ngl
