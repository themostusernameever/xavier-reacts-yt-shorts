so basically, in the last 3 days i've been noticing a lot of shorts that look like this: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/shorts/-TN_uQVQaX8">like here</a>
so, i've decided to make a script, that kinda makes this much faster.

this script uses moviepy to make videos and praw to search reddit for memes.

**usage**
when running the file for the first time, you need to input your data that the script will ask you. (you can get it here https://www.reddit.com/prefs/apps)
after that, the script verifies your account
next, you input how many videos to make.

The script will then need **2** files:
```input-video.mp4``` - the video of the person staring into the camera (lol)
```input-audio.mp3``` - the background music

they need to be in the same folder as the script!!!

after that, you will need to wait for it to make videos that will be stored in the /output directory
